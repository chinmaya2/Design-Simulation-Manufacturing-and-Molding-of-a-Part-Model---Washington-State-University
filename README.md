# Design-Simulation-Manufacturing-and-Molding-of-a-Part-Model---Washington-State-University
Designed a part using Solidworks with given constraints, conducted its Simulation and Analysis using Solidworks Plastics, MasterCAM, Designed Mold on CNC Machine and made the final part using Injection Molding, Drilling Machine and Lathe Machine.        Guide:  Prof. Arda Gozen &amp; Prof. Kurt Hutchinson 


The Final  Solidworks file is shown under screw2_improved, which shows the final design of the part . Since , a hollow part could not be made out of Injection Molding , I created an Arbor , to support the hollow structure, the file is named  arbor_final.  The arbor's final design was made using a lathe machine.
